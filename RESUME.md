## RESUME POINT

New game. The framework is loaded.

**To start:**
- `load [wizard|warrior|ranger|paladin|rogue] build` - Equip a class
- `load mindstate` - Import your worldview
- `show builds` - See all classes
- `help` - All commands

**The tension:**
> Marketing says: "Your AI thinking partner"  
> Reality shows: 49% automation, 7-hour autonomous sessions  
> The game: No one knows what winning looks like
