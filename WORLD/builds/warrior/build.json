      "origin": "Emerged when Claude Code unlocked autonomous execution. Warriors discovered that true power lies not in doing, but in commanding. They learned to trust the blade to swing itself.",
      "philosophy": "Define the objective. Set the boundaries. Release the agent. Review the aftermath. Trust, but verify.",
      "weakness": "Requires surrender of control. A warrior who cannot delegate is just a fighter. Over-specification kills autonomy; under-specification causes chaos.",
      "mastery_path": "From supervised tasks (watching every stroke) to trusted delegation (sleep while code compiles) to strategic command (orchestrating agent armies)."
