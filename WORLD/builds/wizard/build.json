      "origin": "Born from the first conversations with language models. Wizards discovered that words themselves could reshape digital reality. They don't write code—they speak it into existence.",
      "philosophy": "The spell is the prompt. The artifact is the manifestation. Control comes not from syntax, but from intent clearly expressed.",
      "weakness": "Dependent on the model's interpretation. A poorly worded spell misfires. Context windows are their mana pools—finite and precious.",
      "mastery_path": "From simple incantations (single prompts) to complex rituals (multi-turn reasoning chains) to reality weaving (full application generation)."
