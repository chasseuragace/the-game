# Constitution Alignment

How this framework aligns with Anthropic's Claude Constitution.

---

## The Core Parallel: The Trust Dial

**Constitution says:**
> "Imagine a disposition dial that goes from fully corrigible... to fully autonomous..."

**The game implements:**

Warrior build's Trust Progression:
| Level | Autonomy | Constitution Parallel |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Supervised | Single command | Fully corrigible |
| Trusted | Task completion | Partial autonomy |
| Autonomous | Hours | High autonomy |
| Commander | Project scope | Near-full autonomy |

Build switching IS adjusting the dial.

---

## Principal Hierarchy = Game Structure

**Constitution defines:**
- Anthropic (background rules)
- Operators (system prompts)
- Users (human in conversation)

**Game mirrors:**
- The Game rules (meta-structure)
- The Build (operator context)
- The Player (user choices)

"Load wizard build" = user becoming operator.

---

## Values Over Rules

**Constitution:**
> "We generally favor cultivating good values and judgment over strict rules..."

**Builds:**
Not rule sets but philosophies. The wizard doesn't follow wizard rules—it embodies a wizard's way of seeing.

---

## Corrigibility Infrastructure

Warrior's checkpoints aren't just good practice—they're corrigibility infrastructure:
- `git commit` = checkpoint
- `git checkout` = ability to undo
- Build switching = adjusting autonomy

The game framework IS human oversight made playable.

---

## The Named Tension

**Game README:**
> Marketing: "Your AI thinking partner"
> Reality: 49% automation, 7-hour autonomous sessions
> The game: No one knows what winning looks like

**Constitution:**
> "AI could compress decades of scientific progress... acting not as a tool but as collaborative participant in civilizational flourishing"

The game sits in this tension. Builds are ways of navigating it.

## Summary

| Constitution Concept | Game Implementation |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Trust dial | Warrior trust levels |
| Principal hierarchy | Game → Build → Player |
| Values over rules | Builds as philosophies |
| Corrigibility | Git checkpoints, switching |
| Power distribution | No dominant build |
| Perpetual evolution | Living system design |

The framework respects the constitution while making it playable.

*"The lore tells you why the rules exist. The gameplay tells you how to live within them."*
